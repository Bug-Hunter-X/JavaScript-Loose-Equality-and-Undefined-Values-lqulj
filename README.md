This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in JavaScript involving loose equality checks and undefined values. The file 'bug.js' showcases the problematic code, where the function 'foo' attempts to handle null values but fails to explicitly handle undefined values. This leads to unexpected behavior when undefined values are passed as arguments. The solution, found in 'bugSolution.js', correctly addresses the issue by explicitly checking for both null and undefined values using strict equality (===) or the typeof operator.
